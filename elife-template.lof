We used Epik and Jaguar to predict microscopic pKa values (denoted as Type I predictions in SAMPL6). The macrostate populatons from experiment, and microstate populations from predictions can be compared directly to an experimental titration curve derived from UV. Since NMR data was available for this molecule, the charge state in the experiment is also known. \relax }}{7}{figure.caption.27}

We used Epik scan mode to predict most prevalent microstates from sequential pKa values, which can approximate macroscopic pKa values.
